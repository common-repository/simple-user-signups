Capture more leads by allowing users to sign up for a WordPress account with only their email address.  User's passwords can be randomly generated and emailed to them or you can set the option to allow users to choose their own password.  Their username is their email address.

== Description ==

This plugin makes creating a WordPress account as easy as possible.  Users can sign up for an account by simply entering their email address.  Their password is randomly generated and emailed to them and their username is their email address.

It is recommended that you embed the signup form in a secure page that uses https for security purposes.

This plugin was developed to make capturing leads easier.  Too many inputs and long signup forms can result in high bounce rates and ultimately lost business.

Simple Signup Forms allows you to create as many different signup forms as you'd like, each with it's own unique settings and links.

You can direct users to specific pages after they've created and account and logged in, send download links, customize your email messages and more.

Simple Signup Forms is perfect for landing pages of all types.  After a user has entered their email address you can send them a download link to an ebook, link to the beginning of a course, or link to a product among many other things.

== Installation ==

1. Copy the plugin folder into your WordPress plugin directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use the shortcode [simple-signup] with the parameter id set to the id of the form.  This can be found in the "shortcodes" column when viewing all forms in the admin area.  The shortcode will look like [simple-signup id="893"] where id is the id of your form.
